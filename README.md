## The instructions for building the search engine were:

You are writing an article about what language backgrounds kindergarden aged kids come from in Finland. As a part of the article you want to create a search engine where people can search up different municipalities and see how many kids in early childhood education are non-finnish speaking in said municipalities. The data in the serach engine should be presented in an unbiased way. You have two hours to spend, make a quick user interface for the serch engine.

The data for the task was gotten from Tilastokeskus.

## Things I considered while building the search engine

How to present the data in a way that:
1. Protects peoples privacy.
2. Allows for easy comparison between municipalities.
3. Is immediately understandable to the reader.
4. Is accessible.
